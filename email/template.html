Dear {mentor},
<br>
Thanks for your mentor application for the Fall 2023 batch. We're excited that you truly believe in our vision and want to do your part to help the tech community. We’re nearing the end of the matching process for this batch and we’re reaching out to mentors to seek confirmation of their mentee assignments. Please keep the following in mind while reviewing your mentee matches:

<ol>
  <li>The matching process is a semi-automated pipeline where we take into account mentee/mentor expectations, technical area match, goals from the relationship and profile match. The priority of these constraints may vary for each mentoring track. Please make sure that you look at the match in a holistic manner and reject mentees only if you think you cannot provide absolutely any value to them.</li>
  <li>The assignments were made based on the time-commitment specified in the application form. For almost all mentoring tracks, we recommend one 60 minute mentoring session per month. Tracks that have a strict deadline like University Admissions might require more frequent sessions, however, the length of your mentoring relationship will be short.</li>
  <li>We will send out a detailed on-boarding guide once you've confirmed the assignments. If you’ve applied to be a mentee as well, we will reach out to you after all the mentors have confirmed their assignments.</li>
</ol>

Please review the below assignments and send out a reply to us by <b>11/23/2022</b>:

Time commitment specified by you: <b>{time_commitment}</b>
Mentoring tracks selected by you: <b>{mentoring_track}</b>

    <p>If you're satisfied with all your mentee assignments, please reply “Confirmed”. If you want to choose only some mentees, please send out their names and also mention the reasons for rejection. This is for feedback purposes only and will help us re-assign a better match for you if 
    Looking forward to hearing from you!
